# INET 5010 - Chinook App Backend Assignment 1

**First of Three Cumulative Assignments**

Welcome to the Chinook App Backend Assignment 1! Your mission is to build the initial backend logic for the Chinook App, ensuring that the provided frontend/client files work seamlessly without any modifications. This assignment is the first of three cumulative tasks, each building upon the other. You are a vital part of the development team, entrusted with creating the necessary server endpoints to fetch and deliver data from the Chinook SQLite database.

## Assignment Background

The Chinook App is designed to interact with the Chinook SQLite databaseâ€”a digital media store managing tracks, albums, and artists. The Frontend Team has already crafted visually appealing pages, and your task is to provide the backend functionality required to dynamically populate these pages with data.

## Requirements

1. **Understand the UI Files:**
   - Examine the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files provided by the Frontend Team.
   - Identify components and pages that require data from the Chinook database.

2. **Serve Static Files with Express.js:**
   - Configure Express.js to serve the provided frontend/client files as 'static' content.
   - This ensures that the frontend files are accessible and can be rendered by the browser.

3. **Create Endpoints using Express.js:**
   - Design a set of Express.js endpoints that provide the necessary data for the frontend/client.
   - Do not modify the provided frontend/client files. Your goal is to make them functional without alterations.

4. **Connect to the Chinook Database:**
   - Utilize the `better-sqlite3` package to connect your Express.js backend to the Chinook SQLite database.

5. **Implement Data Retrieval:**
   - Write SQL queries to fetch the required data for each endpoint.
   - Ensure the retrieved data aligns with the expectations of the UI and is in JSON format.

6. **Start the Express Server:**
   - Set up your Express.js server to listen for incoming requests.
   - Verify that your server is running and ready to serve data to the frontend.

## Testing and Debugging

To ensure the robustness of your backend and the seamless integration with the frontend, make use of the following tools:

- **Browser Developer Tools:**
  - Use the browser's developer tools to inspect network requests, console logs, and troubleshoot issues with data fetching.

- **Postman or Similar API Testing Tools:**
  - Test your Express.js endpoints using tools like Postman to verify the correctness of data retrieval and response formats.

## Important Note

**Do not modify the provided frontend files.** Your task is to create a robust backend that seamlessly integrates with the existing frontend. Any changes to the frontend files are outside the scope of this assignment.

## Need Help?

If you encounter difficulties or have questions, reach out to your instructor for clarification. They are here to support you throughout the assignment.

## Your Impact

By successfully completing this assignment, you'll provide the frontend with the means to display dynamic and up-to-date information from the Chinook database. This assignment is the first of three cumulative tasks, and your subsequent assignments will build upon the foundation you create here.

Good luck, and happy coding!
